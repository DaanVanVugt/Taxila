    <p>
      In the context of TeSS, a training material is a link to a single online training material sourced by a
      content provider (such as a text on a Web page, presentation, video, etc.) along with description and other
      meta information (e.g. ontological categorization, keywords, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      TeSS harvests materials automatically, including descriptions and other relevant meta-data made available by
      providers. Materials can also be registered manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your website contains training materials that you wish to include in TeSS,
      please contact the TeSS team (<a href="mailto:tess@elixir-uk.info">tess@elixir-uk.info</a>) for further details.
