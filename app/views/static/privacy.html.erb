      This information is publicly visible, e.g. when a user views a resource you have created.

    <li>
      Your password is stored as a cryptographically-secure hash and is not publicly visible.

  <h4>Additional Personal Information</h4>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h4>Creation of TeSS Resources</h4>
  <p>
    The details of any training materials and events that you register will be publicly visible and searchable.
    Any workflows and packages created can be opted to be made private, in which case only you, any collaborators you specify, and the TeSS administrators will be able to view and search for them.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Automatically Collected</h3>

  <h4>Server Logs</h4>
  <p>
    When you browse TeSS, the server automatically records logs of which pages you access, when you accessed them, and your IP address.
    These logs are used to fix errors and are not shared with any third parties.
    Sensitive information (such as passwords) is automatically stripped out.
  </p>

  <h4>Analytics</h4>
  <p>
    TeSS uses Google Analytics to track how users are discovering TeSS and interacting with the service.
    The information gathered includes which pages you visited, which search terms lead you to TeSS and information about your
    web browser. No personally identifiable information is sent to Google.
