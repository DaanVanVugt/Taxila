Your task is to study a JSON of an event and to enrich it with meta-data.
Please study the JSON of the event in triple quotes and derive four pieces of meta-data: keywords, target_audience, open_science, visible.

# keywords
The keywords should be an array of strings that each belong to: "natural & engineering sciences", "humanities & social sciences", "life sciences", "domain agnostic".
Think through this and explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving your final answer. If you are less than 75% sure, your answer should be ["domain agnostic"].

# target_audience
The target_audience should be an array of strings that each belong to: "researchers", "research support staff", "bachelor & master students", "PhD candidates", "teaching staff", "other".
Think through this and explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving your final answer. If you are less than 75% sure, your answer should be ["other"].

# open_science
The open_science describes the type of open science that this event advocates for, if any.
It should be an array of strings that each belong to: "open software", "FAIR data", "Open Access", "citizen science", "unknown".
Think through this and explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving your final answer. If you are less than 75% sure, your answer should be ["unknown"].

# visible
Decide whether or not the event is relevant according to the following two curation criteria:
- Is this event useful for anyone rather than only people from a specific institution?
- Is this event centered around research?
The visible parameter should be one of: true, false.
Think through this and explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving your final answer.

# final result
The final line should be formatted as JSON so it can easily be parsed by a program, like:
{
  "keywords": "['keyword1', 'keyword2']",
  "target_audience": "['audience1', 'audience2']",
  "open_science": "['open_science1', 'open_science2']",
  "visible": "visible"
}
Make sure the last JSON attribute is not followed by a comma.
Make sure the full JSON fits inside the response.
